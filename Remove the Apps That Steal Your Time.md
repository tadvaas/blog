# Remove the Apps That Steal Your Time
Your phone doesn’t need to do everything. Simplify it by removing apps that distract you the most.

## Say Goodbye to Social Media Apps
Social media apps are designed to keep you scrolling. By removing them:
- You eliminate mindless checking.
- You save your focus for things that matter.
- You can still check your socials—but only on a computer. 
This ensures you engage with social media intentionally, not impulsively.

## Limit Communication Apps
Keep only two communication methods:
- WhatsApp for cross-platform messaging.
- iMessage because it's a default app.
Having fewer ways to communicate reduces interruptions and the pressure to respond instantly.

## Get Rid of Email Apps
Email is one of the most distracting tools on your phone. Here’s why it doesn’t belong there:
- Emails interrupt your day with unnecessary stress.
- Checking email on a computer forces you to schedule it intentionally.
- Set alarms to remind yourself when to check email, whether it’s every 24 hours or at scheduled intervals during the day.

## Disable All Notifications
Notifications are the ultimate attention hijackers. To untrap your iPhone, you need to silence them all.

### Turn Off Everything
Turn off notifications for every app. Yes, everything. This stops your phone from demanding attention for trivial reasons.

### Turn Back Only Call Notifications
The only exception should be calls. If something is urgent, people will call you. Otherwise, your time remains yours.

### Declutter Your Apple Watch
If you use an Apple Watch, keep it distraction-free as well:

- Disable notifications entirely.
- Remove unused apps.
- Stick to essential apps like Workouts and Now Playing (to skip ads during podcasts).

## Organise Your iPhone with Three Screens
Your iPhone needs structure. Here’s how to organise it for simplicity and focus:

### Home Screen: Your Main Hub
This is where essential apps and organised folders live. Keep it minimal to avoid overwhelm.

### Testing Screen: For New Apps
Every new app goes here for evaluation. During the testing stage, be extremely critical. Remember: Apps are built to sell you something—they don’t have your best interests at heart. After a few days, decide, does the app genuinely add value? If yes, move it to the home screen. If not, delete it immediately.

### App Library: The Necessary Evil
The App Library is a default screen from Apple. While you can’t disable it, avoid using it as much as possible. Treat it like a junk drawer—only go there when absolutely necessary.

## Fix Your Email
Emails are another form of attention theft. Let’s declutter and streamline your inbox.

- In your email settings, create a folder called Ads.
- Filter all emails containing the word "unsubscribe" to go directly to this folder.
- Ensure these emails skip your inbox and are automatically marked as read.

Promotional emails are subtle traps—they’re designed to sell you something, even if it’s not immediate. By filtering them out, you avoid constant exposure to adverts and create a calmer inbox experience.

## Why Are We Doing This?
The steps above aren’t just about decluttering your phone—they’re about reclaiming your focus, time, and mental space. Here’s the reasoning:

- Social Media: Checking it on a computer makes the experience intentional, not habitual.
- Notifications: By silencing them, you remove external triggers and distractions.
- App Organisation: A structured phone keeps you focused and discourages mindless browsing.
- Email: Promotional emails are attention traps; filtering them ensures they don’t waste your time.

Your iPhone should serve you—not the other way around. By removing distracting apps, silencing notifications, organising your screens, and fixing your email, you can break free from the phone trap. These steps are simple but powerful and will help you regain control over your attention and time.
